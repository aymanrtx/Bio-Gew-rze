# Order Display Fix Summary

## Problem
Orders stored in Sanity were not displaying on the user's orders page due to a mismatch between the `clerkUserId` used when creating the checkout session and the `userId` of the logged-in user.

## Root Causes Identified & Fixed

### 1. Query Typo in Sanity Query
**File**: `sanity/queries/query.ts`
**Issue**: The query was ordering by `orderData` instead of `orderDate`
**Fix**: Changed `order(orderData desc)` to `order(orderDate desc)`

### 2. Optional clerkUserId Interface
**File**: `actions/createCheckoutSession.ts`
**Issue**: The `clerkUserId` field was marked as optional (`clerkUserId?: string`) which could lead to undefined values
**Fix**: Made `clerkUserId` required (`clerkUserId: string`)

### 3. Missing Validation in Cart Page
**File**: `app/(client)/cart/page.tsx`
**Issue**: No validation to ensure `user.id` and email exist before creating checkout session
**Fix**: Added proper validation and error handling

### 4. Lack of Error Handling in Webhook
**File**: `app/(client)/api/webhook/route.ts`
**Issue**: No validation to ensure `clerkUserId` exists before creating order
**Fix**: Added validation and error logging

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Query Typo
```typescript
// Before
const MY_ORDERS_QUERY = defineQuery(`*[_type == 'order' && clerkUserId == $userId] | order(orderData desc)`);

// After  
const MY_ORDERS_QUERY = defineQuery(`*[_type == 'order' && clerkUserId == $userId] | order(orderDate desc)`);
```

### 2. Made clerkUserId Required
```typescript
// Before
export interface Metadata {
  clerkUserId?: string;
  // ... other fields
}

// After
export interface Metadata {
  clerkUserId: string;
  // ... other fields
}
```

### 3. Added Validation in Cart Page
```typescript
// Added validation before checkout
if (!user?.id) {
  toast.error("User ID is missing. Please try logging out and logging back in.");
  return;
}

if (!user?.emailAddresses?.[0]?.emailAddress) {
  toast.error("Email address is missing. Please check your account settings.");
  return;
}
```

### 4. Added Webhook Validation
```typescript
// Added validation in webhook
if (!clerkUserId) {
  console.error('clerkUserId is missing from webhook metadata');
  throw new Error('clerkUserId is required but was not provided');
}
```

### 5. Added Debug Logging
Added console.log statements throughout the flow to help identify issues:
- Cart page: Logs metadata being sent
- Webhook: Logs received metadata
- Orders page: Logs userId being used for query
- getMyOrders: Logs query results

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test New Orders
1. Clear your cart and add some products
2. Go to checkout and complete a purchase
3. Check the console logs to verify:
   - Cart page shows correct `clerkUserId` in metadata
   - Webhook receives and processes the `clerkUserId`
   - Orders page queries with the correct `userId`

### 2. Debug Existing Orders
Run the debug script to check existing orders:
```bash
node debug-orders.js
```

This will show:
- Total number of orders
- Which orders have missing `clerkUserId`
- All unique `clerkUserId` values in the database

### 3. Check Orders Page
1. Go to `/orders` page
2. Check browser console for logs showing:
   - `userId` being used for query
   - Number of orders found
3. Orders should now display if they have matching `clerkUserId`

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Migration Script for Existing Orders
If you have existing orders without `clerkUserId`, you may need to create a migration script to:
- Match orders to users based on email
- Update existing orders with the correct `clerkUserId`

### 2. Environment Variables
Ensure all required environment variables are set:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET`
- `SANITY_API_TOKEN`
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### 3. Remove Debug Logging
Once the issue is resolved, remove the debug console.log statements from:
- `app/(client)/cart/page.tsx`
- `app/(client)/api/webhook/route.ts`
- `app/(client)/orders/page.tsx`
- `sanity/queries/index.ts`

### 4. Delete Debug Files
Remove the temporary debug file:
- `debug-orders.js`
- `ORDER_FIX_SUMMARY.md`

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] New orders are created with correct `clerkUserId`
- [ ] Webhook processes orders without errors
- [ ] Orders page displays user's orders
- [ ] Debug script shows orders with `clerkUserId`
- [ ] Console logs show proper flow (can be removed after testing)
- [ ] Error handling works for missing user data
